# US6 - To log in to the system


## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As a (non-authenticated) Backoffice User, I want to log in to the system using my
credentials, so that I can access the backoffice features according to my assigned
role.

### 1.2. Acceptance Criteria

* **AC1:** Backoffice users log in using their username and password.
* **AC2:**  Role-based access control ensures that users only have access to features appropriate to their
role (e.g., doctors can manage appointments, admins can manage users and settings).
* **AC3:** After five failed login attempts, the user account is temporarily locked, and a notification is
sent to the admin.
* **AC4:** Login sessions expire after a period of inactivity to ensure security.
